# Cultural Indices Dashboard

## Overview
This project visualizes cultural indices using an interactive dashboard built with **Dash** and **Plotly**. The dashboard compares survey-based cultural indices with ChatGPT-transformed data, allowing users to filter by region and explore the relationships between cultural metrics.

## Features
- Interactive scatter plots comparing **Survey** and **ChatGPT** cultural indices.
- Dropdown menus to filter data by regions.
- Visual insights into the dimensions:
  - **Survival vs. Self-Expression**
  - **Traditional vs. Secular**
- Easy deployment to local or cloud platforms (e.g., Render).

## Demo
- **Live Link**: [Insert your deployed app link here]
